			<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Alexandra Sonya Bradley. Welcome to my own personal website! This is my first time making a website, but hopefully, it will work as I imagine. I wanted to do a bit more than was required, only to realize that I cannot quite figure out the details needed to make my grand visions work. However, this website is slowly coming together and (since I like bragging) is looking great!</p>

			<p>From top to bottom, the videos are "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", "Mary had a little lamb", and "Happy Birthday". I am still very much an amateur, but ocarinas are fun. Mine is a 12-hole ocarina.</p>

            <h2>Info about the Website</h2><br>
			<p>So, this website will be all about me, myself, and I. It will include pictures, videos, anything and everything I feel like throwing in here and can do successfully. Hopefully, you will learn a lot about me. For example, I love medieval literature and clothes!</p> <img src="images/self/medieval.jpg" alt="Alexandra in a medieval dress">
