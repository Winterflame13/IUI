			<p>Most of my pictures are when I was little. I loved the beach as a kid. I still do! As a child though, I had severe hydrophobia. But I loved the feeling of the waves, building sandcastles, and collecting seashells. I almost grabbed a jellyfish once! I thought it was a sanddollar...</p>
			<p>I also got very brown in the sun as a child. I had so many experiences! I caught fish, was tricked into trying to hold an eel, and even received lessons on driving my Grandpa Uncle Bobby's boat. He was Grandpa Uncle, because I confused him with my Grandpa Bobby.</p>

			<p>Boating was a lot of fun! That was around the time I was starting to wear glasses, and I got the clipped on sunglass lens to attach to my glasses. My Grandpa Uncle Bobby trusted me to follow instructions as long as I could see, and taught me how to work his boat. I had to clean it afterwards though...so he still got a better deal! However, thanks to him, I learned a lot about fishing, crabbing, cooking seafood, and how to tell the difference between male and female crabs (I forgot though, hehe).</p>

			<p>I just decided on a whim to share this picture. This is when I first caught a fish. I was around five, and I remember is was big, floppy, and slimy. I was proud I caught it, but absolutely disgusted!I still tried to smile for the picture. That obviously did not work out so well.</p>
