			<p>So, my college life interesting. The most memorable were the pictures at the end! I studied English Literature, focusing on Ancient and Medieval Literature, and Victorian British literature. I did my senior comprehension essay and presentation on Charles Dickens' <em>Little Dorrit</em>, Jane Austen's <em>Mansfield Park</em>, and Charlotte Bronte's <em>Jane Eyre</em>. It was a combination of women in literature, Victorian literature, and clothing. I used clothing to describe impressions, treatment, and assumptions made in society, especially concerning women.</p>
			<p>It was overall an interesting experience, going so far away from home after having never left home before. Making and losing friends, talking with professors, taking the courses I wanted to take and needed to take. Not being able to bring my sweet dog with me was a bit painful. Being forced to interact with my peers caused some heartache and headaches, but I certianly did learn alot about social interactions. I do still struggle with asking blunt questions in a non-offensive way though.</p>

			<p>In one pic, I am in some native beaded jewelry (necklace and earrings) with a beaded eagle feather fan. At such an event, I earned my feathers. In the second pic, I got my class ring for SMC 2022.</p>

            <p>There are little to no photos of my life in college, as I hardly ever take photos of myself. Therefore, I put in my graduation photos my friends forced me to take.</p>
