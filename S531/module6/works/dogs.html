            <h2>My beautiful boys!</h2><img src="../images/dogs/apollo.jpg" alt="Apollo">
			<p>Apollo is a beautiful soul. He is 8 years old, born July 11. He is a white standard-sized goldendoodle. He has slowly turned a bit more grumpy, but he is extremely attached to me. He knows he is my mother's dog, but I am his human. He believes he has raised me and taken care of me. Poor Apollo can no longer deal with any separation from me now.</p> <br>
			<img src="../images/dogs/artemis.jpg" alt="Artemis">
			<p>Artemis is the second eldest dog. He is around 2 years old, born April 23. He is the smallest dog we have, about 5.44-6.8 kilograms, or 12-15 pounds. He is a red/brown mini-sized goldendoodle. My parents teasingly call him a toy-sized dog. I think he would make a great purse dog! He is a huge crybaby though, scared of almost anything and everything. I do wonder how he would react to waves on the beach. He is also extremely aggressive of a hunter, and can go after birds, mice, rabbits, voles, moles. He plays with his prey a bit viciously, accidently killing them. Then he gets mad that they cannot "play" anymore.</p> <br>
			<img src="../images/dogs/arthur.jpg" alt="Arthur">
			<p> Arthur is the third child. He is around 1 year old, born November 1. He is about 20 pounds, or 9.07 kilograms. He is the sweetest and gentlest dog you could ever meet. He is a black/blue marble mini-sized goldendoodle. He loves kisses, hugs, and dancing. He learned how to dance from Apollo. He is also extremely curious. He is a hunter like Artemis is, but he would never hunt to kill.</p> <br>
			<img src="../images/dogs/merlinarthur.jpg" alt="Merlin tail wagging">
			<p>Merlin is the youngest, yet biggest of the three mini-sized goldendoodle. He was born May 23, so he is 9 months old. He is about 23 pounds, or 10.4 kilograms. He is an extremely jealous dog, but very smart, and very much like a poodle. His is a brown mini-sized goldendoodle, and is very much an outdoor dog. He loves to play and loves to be stroked on his head. He is horrible at fetching or hunting. He certainly cannot track anything (with nose or eyes).</p>

			<p>They do sit in an order. Apollo sits, with Arther and Artemis right in front of him, and Merlin sits like a statue further away behind them all.</p>
