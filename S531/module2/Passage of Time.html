<h1>Passage of Time</h1> 
<h2>Alexandra Bradley</h2>
<h3>inspired by Sappho's <i>147</i></h3>

<p><em>Note: This poem is written by Alexandra Bradley, who was inspired in presenting a meaning to Sappho's peoms, from which only phrases or words survived the test of time. Those words were italicized throughout the peom.</em></p>

<p>
<i>Someone will remember us</i>, after we are gone.<br>
We are people who live in the past,<br>
but we are famous in our own right.<br>
We are written down in poetry, placed in books,<br>
Painted in pictures, and told stories about by descendants.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps our names will be forgotten, but who we are,<br>
<i>I say</i>, is something that will live through the ages.<br>
Perhaps it will be the other way around,<br>
where only our names are remembered.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, like the gods, we may one day not be remembered<br>
Because we became unnecessary in the future.<br>
But even then, someone someday, will uncover our lives<br>
And we will live on,through myths and legends,<br>
Through memory and tales, <i>even in another time</i>.
